This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional background as a Java Full Stack Developer.

The primary goal of this portfolio is to provide a clean, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing platform to highlight my technical competencies, particularly in Java/Spring Boot backend development and modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend design.

The current version of the application is built as a single-page application (SPA) using clean, custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating strong fundamentals in core web technologies.
